                <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-8">
                  My passion for event coordination began during my upbringing in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where coming together in celebration was a central aspect of life. While pursuing new career opportunities, I relocated to Pretoria while maintaining my devotion to uplifting others.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-8">
                  With a background in Human Resources and Commerce, I have cultivated a skill set that includes event planning, fundraising, and relationship building. My experience is broad, ranging from team-building activities to conferences and product launches.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl mb-8">
                  I excel at facilitating engaging and memorable events tailored to meet the unique needs of my clients.
